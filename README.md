## Additional informations concerning Legacy Commands
The "[Legacy Commands](./Cat11%20-%20Legacy%20Commands)" section contains older commands that are no longer in use.

All legacy commands were either replaced by lot more reliable and flexible rewritten counterparts or just simply deprecated because we don't need them anymore. Those commands are only kept for archival purposes.

For example, [-lgoulag](./Cat11%20-%20Legacy%20Commands/CC077%20•%20CMD%20-%20lgoulag.yag), [-lungoulag](./Cat11%20-%20Legacy%20Commands/CC078%20•%20CMD%20-%20lungoulag.yag), [-lmine](./Cat11%20-%20Legacy%20Commands/CC199%20•%20CMD%20-%20lmine.yag), [-lban](./Cat11%20-%20Legacy%20Commands/CC206%20•%20CMD%20-%20lban.yag), [-lkick](./Cat11%20-%20Legacy%20Commands/CC207%20•%20CMD%20-%20lkick.yag), [-lsban](./Cat11%20-%20Legacy%20Commands/CC311%20•%20CMD%20-%20lsban.yag) commands are all deprecated since March 28, 2023 as they were replaced with more modern and reliable counterparts.
